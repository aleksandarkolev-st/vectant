# GPU HMR Universal Acceptance Implementation Status

Status date: 2026-06-23

This document records the current implementation status against `GPU_HMR_UNIVERSAL_ACCEPTANCE_PROOF_PLAN.md`.

## Executive Status

Accepted local proof is ROCm/HIP on the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT (`gfx1201`). CUDA was not validated on this machine.

Current accepted proof is broader than one fixture, but it is not universal production acceptance:

- strict ROCm/HIP full-runtime proof-ledger acceptance for generated HIP device artifacts,
- MCP preview visual HMR for generated ray-light and Flow workloads with cold split, hot delta 1, hot delta 2 with a different edit, and negative edit refusal,
- deterministic generated-split fission verification for ray-light `trace_light_rays`,
- HIPRT same-process CameraRays ray-traced visual proof with embedded proof ledger, strict runtime proof artifact, shader-cache artifact binding, data-derived nonblank oracle-region proof, and full cold/hot1/hot2-different-edit/negative run-mode coverage,
- ThreeJS external runtime visual proof as an external screenshot profile,
- WebGPU Chrome/AMD RDNA4 runtime visual HMR proof for an explicit-empty-layout WGSL shader/pipeline profile.

Current fail-closed evidence also includes:

- large real ROCm ML infrastructure validation against upstream MIOpen, which builds and runs and is now a first-class validation-matrix row, but is refused because full-runtime Synthi proof ledger, strict runtime proof artifact, and output/visual oracle proof are missing,
- negative/rejection evidence for HIPRT blank-frame direct-light-zero, OIDN HIP, Bevy, OpenCL, and Vulkan where proof is missing, blank, or the runtime dependency is incompatible.

Current strict matrix behavior deliberately downgrades older HIPRT warm visual artifacts that lack an embedded proof ledger and data-derived oracle-region proof. HIPRT matrix ingestion now recomputes the oracle region from the persisted before/after PNG pixels; JSON claims about a nonblank region are not accepted by themselves. A fresh 2026-06-22 HIPRT CameraRays rerun is accepted as strict full-runtime HIPRT GPU HMR. The MegaKernel direct-light-zero profile is now a proven blank-oracle-region refusal, not a success. OIDN live preflight ran against the real HIPRT checkout and remains rejected for HIP output proof because the installed OIDN HIP device library depends on `libamdhip64.so.5`, which is absent on this ROCm 7 worker. No symlink, ABI shim, fake ICD, or synthesized runtime was added.

The latest generated machine-readable validation matrix ledger reports 34 rows: 13 full-runtime GPU HMR rows, 1 deterministic generated-split fission verifier row, 1 external visual-profile row, 12 structured refusal rows, 1 preflight-only row, 6 cold split rows, and 0 unproven rows in the default included set. The matrix hash is:

```

The global per-target run-mode coverage row is `accepted` for the 2 enrolled generated visual run-mode targets. SAXPY and scoped WebGPU triangle remain valid full-runtime evidence rows outside that generated run-mode-suite obligation.

The backend-specific `hiprt_run_modes` coverage row is now `accepted` for `hiprt-camera-rays-horizontal-mirror`: it has structured cold runtime visual evidence, hot delta 1, hot delta 2 with a different source edit, and an ABI-changing negative-edit refusal. This still does not mean broad HIPRT acceptance; it means the scoped CameraRays profile now satisfies the plan's run-mode sequence without overclaiming other HIPRT kernels or applications.

This is not yet production-grade acceptance for every arbitrary GPU project. The current accepted scope is ROCm/HIP plus the explicitly proven visual/runtime paths above, including the scoped HIPRT CameraRays and scoped WebGPU paths.

Still open or refused: CUDA, MIOpen full-runtime GPU HMR, HIPRT MegaKernel direct-light-zero, OIDN HIP output proof, Vulkan, OpenCL full-runtime acceptance, Bevy, and broader WebGPU profiles with bind groups, vertex buffers, or engine-owned pipeline caches.

## Hard Rules Preserved

- No hardcoded proof success paths were added.
- No shims were added.
- MIOpen was added as a profile-driven large real ROCm project validation target. The runner reads repo, target, build, launch, and oracle settings from the profile/env path; there is no MIOpen-specific success branch.
- Large real ROCm project validation rows are matrix-ingested through generic `real_rocm_profile` evidence and still fail closed unless a strict runtime proof artifact, recomputed proof ledger, and artifact-backed output oracle are present. Top-level `output_proof.accepted=true` flags are ignored for acceptance; visual-ledger outputs require readable visual artifact files.
- Large real ROCm compute-oracle rows now re-read `raw_readback_bin`, `readback_schema_json`, and `rendered_card_png` from disk and derive hash, byte-length, deterministic-slice, schema, and PNG-card proof from those files. Embedded `raw_readback_hash_verified` or `deterministic_slice_hash_verified` booleans are not authority, and compute-ledger rows cannot pass by attaching unrelated top-level visual files.
- Real ROCm runtime output-oracle profiles now sync by configured worker container instead of MCP transport. Local MCP validation can still deliver a profile into the real worker when a profile is declared; the latest MIOpen profile declares `profile=none`, so the worker oracle file was cleared and the run correctly remained refused.
- Real ROCm runtime evidence is now collected from the configured worker container even when the MCP transport is local. The latest MIOpen run therefore records observed native launch-boundary evidence and the absence of Synthi dispatch, artifact transport, epoch swap, output oracle, and host-preservation proof instead of treating missing docker transport as missing evidence.
- Native ROCm/HIP launch-boundary evidence is now a first-class refusal facet in the runtime proof artifact and derived acceptance contract. It is explicitly marked `can_satisfy_dispatch_proof=false`; observed native function resolution cannot satisfy GPU HMR without Synthi artifact transport, epoch publication, dispatch, output oracle, and host-preservation proof.
- Large ROCm runtime eligibility is now a separate evidence-only facet. It can identify a HIP candidate, source dialects, candidate artifact identity, compiler, and missing proof gates for a serious project such as MIOpen, but it is explicitly `candidate_metadata_only_not_gpu_hmr_success` and cannot authorize backend, dispatch, epoch, or oracle proof.
- Large real ROCm profiles can now declare generic runtime output-oracle profiles and target-progression defaults. The latest MIOpen profile declares `outputOracle.profile=none` and required `targetProgression.phase=final-acceptance`, so the result explicitly reports no installed oracle and fails the missing prior-phase/full-runtime/visual gates instead of implying hidden proof.
- The validation matrix now preserves each real ROCm row's `outputOracleResolution`, `targetProgression`, `targetProgressionGates`, `nativeRocmLaunchBoundary`, and `realRocmRuntimeEligibility` metadata, so large-project refusal gaps are machine-auditable without relying on raw logs.
- Visual matrix acceptance now decodes PNG artifacts with `sharp`; PNG headers or existing files are not enough. Run-mode visual proofs cannot opt out with `visualRequired=false`, and Flow/ray-light coverage requires accepted visual evidence.
- Docker proof runners now require explicit runtime configuration instead of baked-in endpoint/container/entry defaults.
- Visual evidence must be readable image artifacts; invalid image placeholders are rejected.
- `wait_hmr` now returns embedded proof ledger and runtime proof artifact materials for full-runtime GPU proof waits; matrix acceptance recomputes ledger invariants from those materials instead of trusting supplied summaries.
- HIPRT matrix rows require the same embedded proof-ledger/runtime-artifact chain as other full-runtime GPU HMR rows plus matrix-recomputed nonblank oracle-region proof from the persisted PNG pixels; older HIPRT artifacts without that chain are not accepted, and blank render-region outputs are structured refusals.
- Preflight refusal rows require explicit no-shim, no-symlink, and no-synthesized-runtime evidence.
- After `37f110451`, visual HMR success cannot be derived from screenshots or pixel diffs alone. If visual proof is required, the derived proof ledger record must contain `visual_oracle_artifacts`; screenshots remain evidence inputs.
- Compute proof cards are supplemental unless the accepted target is compute-only and backed by deterministic output-oracle proof.
- After `5e1ad07b6`, a placeholder `requiredOracleId` no longer satisfies fission output proof. Fission candidates require a verified inline proposal or resolved output-oracle contract.
- One generated `.hip` file is not proof by itself. The ray-light generated split now proves per-kernel/smallest-safe fission only because the deterministic verifier saw one selected device role, one kernel, full runtime proof, and a frame-gated visual oracle. Flow still refuses per-kernel/smallest-safe fission because the selected device role owns two kernels.

The agent-split visual runner embeds MCP visual oracle artifacts into recomputed proof-ledger records for hot deltas.
Hot-delta-2 visual proof now captures a fresh pre-edit baseline instead of comparing against the previous hot-delta transition.

HIPRT warm visual rows without embedded ledgers are downgraded instead of accepted.
Preflight refusals require explicit no-shim, no-symlink, and no-synthesized-runtime evidence.
MCP compile dispatch is no longer treated as proof when a required wait/proof gate fails.
Generated device edits now require synthi_wait_hmr to apply with the required GPU proof state.
The agent-split visual runner fails immediately when the initial GPU compile produces no device compile marker.
The runner fails immediately when GPU split endpoint evidence is missing after initial compile.

What changed:

```text
fission_report now carries deterministic verifier identity, selection decision hash, and output_oracle_contract.
fission acceptance rejects bare placeholder oracle ids.
runtime visual proof artifacts are blocked when the derived proof ledger record lacks visual_oracle_artifacts.
strict runtime artifact gates reject invented source-consistency modes and require deterministic visual-mode evaluation for visual ledgers.
OpenCL preflight now refuses missing runtime evidence and cannot count as dispatch/readback output proof.
Vulkan preflight now refuses missing ICD/tool evidence and cannot count as pipeline, command-buffer, or frame-output proof.
WebGPU preflight now records browser, launch flags, adapter, features, limits, and a diagnostic screenshot while still refusing shader/pipeline/frame HMR proof.
WebGPU runtime visual proof now accepts only an executed explicit-empty-layout WGSL pipeline scope and derives success from shared ledger invariants, visual thresholds, process-continuity evidence, and native WebGPU API evidence.
The timing metrics summary collector now normalizes WebGPU runtime visual proofs into the shared `synthi.gpu.hmr.timing_metrics.v1` schema.
The validation matrix ledger collector now scans proof artifacts and separates full-runtime GPU HMR, external visual-profile proof, preflight-only evidence, structured refusal, and unproven historical attempts.
The matrix self-check includes a forged WebGPU success flag with no ledger/images and verifies it remains unproven.
The validation matrix now derives plan-coverage rows for accepted, visual-profile-only, preflight-only, refused, and missing plan requirements.
Generated split topology now rejects per-kernel HMR unless a deterministic fission verifier proves it, even when a TU contains only one kernel.
Narrow generated fission candidates now require generated-topology evidence plus a binding from generated role path to the content-addressed selected partial artifact.
Generated split deterministic fission now emits all eight required fission evidence categories and is collected as a separate proof class that cannot count as GPU HMR success by itself.
Ray-light generated split fission is accepted for `trace_light_rays`; Flow generated split fission is rejected at `symbol_ownership` because the latest selected device role contains `particle_flow` and `synthi_generated_seed_buffers`.
The validation matrix now records run-mode evidence for accepted rows and derives a separate `per_target_run_modes` coverage row instead of hiding cold/hot-delta gaps.
The matrix now reports per-target run-mode coverage as accepted, partial, or missing and requires negative-edit refusal per accepted target instead of satisfying that gate globally.
Run-mode coverage obligations are now explicit row metadata: structured run-mode proof rows infer `validationTargetScope=run_mode_target`, while other accepted full-runtime evidence rows remain `evidence_row` unless an artifact declares a run-mode obligation.
Standalone external rejection proof artifacts, including Bevy refusals, are first-class matrix rows.
WebGPU full-runtime acceptance now requires an embedded recomputable proof ledger; a supplied query without the underlying ledger is rejected as unproven.
The MCP visual split runner now emits measured monotonic timing summaries for generated device edits.

Important interpretation:

```text
ThreeJS is accepted as an external visual-profile proof, not as a full-runtime GPU HMR proof-ledger row.
WebGPU preflight is runtime capability evidence only; the separate webgpu-wgsl-runtime-triangle row is the scoped full-runtime WebGPU proof.
OpenCL, Vulkan, and Bevy rows are evidence-backed refusals, not GPU HMR acceptance.
The large real ROCm/MIOpen row is an evidence-backed refusal. It is matrix-ingested as a generic real ROCm validation row and remains rejected because strict runtime proof artifact, proof-ledger success, output/visual oracle proof, and required final-acceptance progression gates are missing. The latest matrix row carries `outputOracleResolution` with profile `none`, zero source-derived candidates, no selected source, no contract, and no runtime profile; `targetProgression` showing phase `final-acceptance` and required=true; plus native ROCm launch-boundary and runtime-eligibility gaps showing that native function resolution was evidence only, not Synthi dispatch/epoch/artifact/oracle proof.
Real ROCm validation acceptance requires artifact-backed oracle evidence. A recomputed ledger can satisfy compute-output proof, but visual ledger outputs must also have readable visual files; top-level oracle success booleans are not authority.
OIDN HIP is an evidence-backed refusal from the real 2026-06-22 checkout preflight; CPU OIDN diagnostics passed, HIP device creation/readback failed, and no shim/symlink/synthesized runtime was applied.
HIPRT CameraRays is accepted only for the strict same-process ray-traced CameraRays profile, with the matrix recomputing oracle-region nonblank proof from persisted before/after PNG pixels. HIPRT MegaKernel direct-light-zero is a proven blank oracle-region refusal. The `hiprt_run_modes` plan row is now `accepted` for CameraRays because structured artifacts prove cold runtime visual evidence, hot delta 1, hot delta 2 with a different edit, and ABI-changing negative-edit refusal.
The per-kernel/smallest-safe fission row is a deterministic fission verifier proof, not a full-runtime GPU HMR row. Runtime acceptance remains ledger-gated.
The global `per_target_run_modes` plan row is accepted for 2 enrolled run-mode targets because generated Flow and ray-light carry the full cold/hot1/hot2-different-edit/negative-edit sequence. SAXPY and scoped WebGPU rows remain accepted full-runtime evidence rows outside that run-mode-suite obligation. Scoped HIPRT CameraRays has its own backend-specific `hiprt_run_modes=accepted` row; stale cold-only artifacts no longer create phantom full-runtime target gaps, and negative-edit refusal is evaluated per enrolled target.
```

Formatting note: `git diff --check` passed for the Rust fission patch. `cargo fmt --check` could not be run in the available builder-test image because rustfmt is not installed, and `cargo` is not installed on the Windows host.

After commit `92543192f`, the accepted runtime artifact was re-summarized through the patched summary builder:

```text
summary gpu_hmr_success: true
summary full_runtime_proven: true
summary limitations: []
summary ledger success: true
summary acceptance contract accepted: true

```

Two later real-ROCm reruns were rejected, correctly:

- `gpu-real-rocm-repo-20260609010632`: worker runtime session was lost during hot delta.
- `gpu-real-rocm-repo-20260609011410`: first compile consumed the first-phase budget and no HMR proof was produced.

Those rejected attempts are not accepted proof.

Visual inspection confirmed a sparse particle ring before HMR and a gridded wave/field after HMR. The diff is nonblank and localized to the changed particle field.

## Generated Split Granularity And Fission

The accepted generated split runtime claim remains device translation unit HMR unless the deterministic fission verifier proves a smaller island. The fission verifier is a separate proof class and cannot count as full-runtime GPU HMR by itself.

Flow:

```

This answers the one-`.hip` concern: one generated `.hip` file is insufficient by itself. Ray-light can claim per-kernel/smallest-safe fission because the selected generated device role contains exactly one kernel and the deterministic verifier is bound to full runtime proof plus frame-gated visual output. Flow cannot claim it because the selected generated device role contains two kernels.

After `732d2bcfa`, a fission candidate that is narrower than the generated device translation unit cannot pass from metadata alone. It must carry deterministic generated-topology evidence and a structured binding that ties:

```text
generated role path -> separately materialized partial artifact -> artifact:sha256 selected artifact identity
```

Missing topology evidence or a missing topology binding rejects with `fission.claim_narrower_than_generated_topology`.

## HIPRT Same-Process Visual HMR

HIPRT proof is separate from the MCP browser preview path. The current accepted HIPRT scope is the same-process CameraRays ray-traced visual profile. It is accepted because the current run emits an embedded proof ledger, strict runtime proof artifact, real shader-cache artifact identity, post-recompile dispatch evidence, deterministic visual mode evidence, and a data-derived nonblank oracle-region check.

The MegaKernel direct-light-zero profile is intentionally not accepted as full-runtime GPU HMR after the oracle-region hardening. It produces a mostly black post-epoch render region, so the matrix records it as a proven blank-frame refusal instead of treating the pixel diff as success.

Visual inspection confirmed CameraRays before/after/diff images are readable and nonblank, with a mirrored/recomposed Cornell-style framebuffer. Visual inspection also confirmed the MegaKernel changed image has a mostly black render region; that is why it is refused despite a high-signal diff image.

## OIDN Status

OIDN was tested in the real HIPRT checkout through a structured preflight artifact on 2026-06-22. The result remains a refusal for HIP output proof: CPU OIDN diagnostics pass, but the installed HIP OIDN device library is linked against `libamdhip64.so.5`, which is unavailable in the ROCm 7 worker environment. No compatibility shim, symlink, fake library, or synthesized runtime was added.

No symlink, ABI shim, or library compatibility shortcut was added. Do not claim OIDN HIP output proof on this ROCm 7 worker.

## OpenCL Status

OpenCL was tested through a structured worker-container preflight artifact:

```text
latest proof id: opencl-preflight-proof:sha256:64e92684b59489f2dc88c1ac6e570fd54605bc9bb345cb6653cc15e22714c4ea

latest summary: mcp/synthi-mcp/.gpu-hmr-test-artifacts/opencl-preflight/opencl-rocm-preflight-20260609-after-output-gate-summary.txt
```

The live worker has an OpenCL loader but no usable vendor ICD/tooling evidence:

```text
libraries: libOpenCL.so.1 (libc6,x86-64) => /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libOpenCL.so.1
vendor ICDs: none
platform count: unknown
device counts: none
unsupported reasons: opencl_vendor_icd_missing, clinfo_missing
```

The preflight artifact explicitly does not accept OpenCL output proof or GPU HMR success. Even on a machine where OpenCL preflight accepts, dispatch trace and output-oracle readback proof are still required before OpenCL GPU HMR can pass.

```text
acceptedForOpenClRuntimePreflight: false
acceptedForOpenClOutputProof: false
gpuHmrSuccess: false
dispatchTraceRequired: true
outputOracleRequired: true
noShimApplied: true
noVendorIcdSynthesized: true
noSymlinkApplied: true
```

No vendor ICD was synthesized, no symlink was added, and no compatibility shim was used. Do not claim OpenCL HMR output proof on this worker.

## Vulkan Status

Vulkan was tested through a structured worker-container preflight artifact:

```text
latest proof id: vulkan-preflight-proof:sha256:d904016a24c785659424bae3cc5381ae2a84b816fee87c1f13dd335709d7a528

latest summary: mcp/synthi-mcp/.gpu-hmr-test-artifacts/vulkan-preflight/vulkan-rocm-preflight-20260609-summary.txt
```

The live worker has a Vulkan loader but no usable ICD/tooling evidence:

```text

ICD files: none
ICD libraries: none
API version: unknown
physical device count: 0
device names: none
unsupported reasons: vulkan_icd_missing, vulkaninfo_missing
```

The preflight artifact explicitly does not accept Vulkan pipeline proof or GPU HMR success. Even on a machine where Vulkan preflight accepts, pipeline-layout proof, command-buffer trace proof, and frame-output oracle proof are still required before Vulkan GPU HMR can pass.

```text
acceptedForVulkanRuntimePreflight: false

gpuHmrSuccess: false
pipelineLayoutProofRequired: true
commandBufferTraceRequired: true
frameOutputOracleRequired: true

```

No ICD was synthesized, no symlink was added, and no compatibility shim was used. Do not claim Vulkan HMR output proof on this worker.

## WebGPU Status

WebGPU was tested through a structured Chrome/Playwright runtime preflight artifact:

```text

latest diagnostic screenshot: mcp/synthi-mcp/.gpu-hmr-test-artifacts/webgpu-preflight/webgpu-preflight-20260609-diagnostic.png
```

The live browser accepted WebGPU runtime preflight:

```text
browser: C:\Program Files\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe
browser launch args: --enable-unsafe-webgpu --ignore-gpu-blocklist --enable-features=Vulkan,WebGPU,UseSkiaRenderer --disable-gpu-sandbox
adapter: {"vendor":"amd","architecture":"rdna-4","device":"","description":""}
preferred canvas format: bgra8unorm
unsupported reasons: none
```

The diagnostic screenshot was visually inspected and is nonblank: it shows a rendered WebGPU triangle plus the runtime JSON (`navigator.gpu`, adapter, device, and render-submit true). This is runtime capability evidence only.

The preflight artifact explicitly does not accept WebGPU shader/pipeline proof or GPU HMR success. Even when WebGPU runtime preflight accepts, WGSL hashes, shader-module epoch, bind-group/pipeline-layout proof, pipeline recreate proof, and frame-output oracle proof are still required before WebGPU GPU HMR can pass.

```text
acceptedForWebGpuRuntimePreflight: true

shaderModuleEpochRequired: true
bindGroupLayoutProofRequired: true

```

No WebGPU shim was added. Browser enablement flags are recorded for transparency and are not counted as HMR proof.

WebGPU runtime visual HMR was then proven for a scoped WGSL shader/pipeline profile:

Earlier strict proof-state rejection:

report: mcp/synthi-mcp/.gpu-hmr-test-logs/external-projects/bevy-wgsl-shader-material-1780961693506-report.json

reason: gpu_hmr_proof_insufficient
required state: gpu-hmr-full-runtime-proven

```

This is a correct refusal, not an accepted arbitrary-project proof.

## Remaining Work

| Plan Area | Current State | Remaining Work |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ROCm/HIP generated runtime | Accepted full-runtime proof exists. | Keep rerun stability high; latest failed reruns must remain rejected. |
| Ray-light/Flow visual MCP | Accepted and visually inspected for June 22 `embedded-ledger-10` slugs; focused matrix proves cold split, hot delta 1, hot delta 2 with different edit, and negative edit refusal. | Keep top-level result files as latest-run convenience outputs only. |
| HIPRT | CameraRays same-process ray-traced visual proof is accepted with embedded ledger/runtime artifact, nonblank oracle-region proof, cold runtime visual evidence, hot delta 1, hot delta 2 with a different edit, and ABI-changing negative-edit refusal. MegaKernel direct-light-zero is refused as blank oracle-region output. | Add additional nonblank HIPRT profiles before claiming broad HIPRT acceptance beyond CameraRays. |
| OIDN | CPU diagnostics pass; HIP backend rejected due `libamdhip64.so.5` dependency mismatch. | Use a matching OIDN HIP build for ROCm 7 or keep OIDN out of accepted HIP proof. No shims. |
| OpenCL | Worker has `libOpenCL.so.1`, but no vendor ICD and no `clinfo`; structured preflight rejected OpenCL runtime proof. | Install/provide a real OpenCL vendor ICD and then add dispatch/event/readback ledger proof. No synthesized ICDs or shims. |
| Vulkan | Worker has `libvulkan.so.1`, but no ICD files and no `vulkaninfo`; structured preflight rejected Vulkan runtime proof. | Provide a real Vulkan ICD/tooling, then add pipeline-layout, command-buffer, frame-boundary, and visual oracle ledger proof. No synthesized ICDs or shims. |
| WebGPU | Scoped Chrome/AMD RDNA4 WGSL runtime visual proof accepted for an explicit-empty-layout, no-bindings, no-vertex-buffers triangle-list pipeline. | Broaden only with executed evidence for bind groups, vertex buffers, pipeline-cache ownership, command/frame traces, and output oracles. Browser flags must remain evidence-only. |
| External projects | ThreeJS visual profile accepted; Bevy remains rejected. Latest run timed out with no decoded frames or visual oracle; an earlier strict gate rejected missing full-runtime proof. | Implement backend-specific full-runtime proof for Bevy before accepting it. |
| CUDA | Not tested on this AMD machine. | Validate only on CUDA hardware. |
| Narrow fission | Deterministic generated-split fission verifier accepted `trace_light_rays` and refused Flow's multi-kernel device role. | Broaden only with verifier evidence for additional backends/projects; do not infer per-kernel fission from one-file output. |
| Browser proof | Preview URLs are live; MCP screenshots exist. | In-app Browser backend was unavailable in this session. |

## Accepted Statement

```text
On the local AMD ROCm machine, Synthi can split generated ROCm/HIP GPU workloads, compile the device artifact with hipcc, hot-reload a device-only edit in a running preview/runtime, prove generated ROCm/HIP device artifacts with strict runtime-ledger acceptance, and provide pixel-backed visual evidence for Flow, ray-light, scoped HIPRT CameraRays with cold/hot1/hot2/negative run-mode coverage, scoped WebGPU WGSL, and external ThreeJS. Blank HIPRT render-region output and ABI-changing HIPRT edits are refused instead of accepted.
```

Do not claim:

```text
CUDA runtime proof was validated here.
Every arbitrary GPU project is production accepted.
The generated ray-light MCP fixture is HIPRT/OIDN.
Broad HIPRT has strict-matrix full-runtime acceptance beyond the scoped CameraRays profile and its structured run-mode sequence.
OIDN HIP produced or validated the accepted output.
OpenCL dispatch/readback output proof was validated on this worker.
Vulkan pipeline/command-buffer/frame output proof was validated on this worker.
General WebGPU bind-group, vertex-buffer, engine-cache, or arbitrary app shader HMR was validated on this worker.
A one-file generated .hip split proves per-kernel or smallest-island fission without deterministic verifier evidence.
Flow's one-file generated .hip split proves per-kernel or smallest-island fission.
Bevy has full-runtime proof-ledger acceptance.
```
